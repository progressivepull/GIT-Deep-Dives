Here's a simple Bash script that reads a CSV file and converts it into a Markdown table format. It assumes the CSV uses commas as delimiters and that the first line contains headers.

``` bash

!/bin/bash

Check if a file was provided
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <csv_file>"
  exit 1
fi

csv_file="$1"

Read the CSV file line by line
{
  IFS=',' read -r -a headers

Print Markdown header row
  printf '|'
  for header in "${headers[@]}"; do
    printf ' %s |' "$header"
  done
  echo

Print Markdown separator row
  printf '|'
  for _ in "${headers[@]}"; do
    printf ' --- |'
  done
  echo

Print the rest of the rows
  while IFS=',' read -r -a row; do
    printf '|'
    for cell in "${row[@]}"; do
      printf ' %s |' "$cell"
    done
    echo
  done
} < "$csv_file"
`
```

# ðŸ›  How to use:
1. Save this script as csvtomd.sh.
2. Make it executable: chmod +x csvtomd.sh
3. Run it with your CSV file: ./csvtomd.sh yourfile.csv
