# üîÅ GitHub Pull Request from a Fork

# üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Production and Worker Codebases
Designating the Production Codebase You're going to use the codebase from the Progressive Pull repository as your production code. This will serve as the main application code, database, and overall source of truth.

Setting Up the Worker Environment You'll create a worker who will fork the production codebase. This forked version will be used for development or task-specific operations, separate from the main production environment.
