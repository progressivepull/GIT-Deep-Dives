# üîÅ GitHub Pull Request from a Fork

## Getting the Code form the Organization's Production Code Repository

You can clone the fork directly from the organization's production code repository. All project repositories are owned and maintained by the organization rather than individual contributors. This structure is especially effective for managing company-wide initiatives or coordinating large open-source efforts.

Setting Up the Worker Environment You'll create a worker who will fork the production codebase. This forked version will be used for development or task-specific operations, separate from the main production environment.

git remote -v
```

## 1. Fetch Changes from Upstream

``` bash
git fetch upstream
```

## 2. Merge Upstream Changes into Your Local Branch
``` bash
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

## 3. Push Updated Main to Your Fork
``` bash
git push origin main
