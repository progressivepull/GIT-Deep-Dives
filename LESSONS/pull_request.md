# üîÅ GitHub Pull Request from a Fork

## Getting the Code form the Organization's Production Code Repository

You can clone the fork directly from the organization's production code repository. All project repositories are owned and maintained by the organization rather than individual contributors. This structure is especially effective for managing company-wide initiatives or coordinating large open-source efforts.

For the new pull request, please ensure the title includes the Jira ticket number and the description is detailed for review. Adhering to a one-ticket-per-pull-request rule is important, as it simplifies the review process and ensures a clear understanding of the changes.
